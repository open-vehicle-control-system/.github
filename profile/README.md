## What is OVCS?

OVCS stands for Open Vehicule Control system. It is a set of open-hardware and open-software components meant as a development platform for tinkering with vehicules.

OVCS is based on simple, off-the-shelve components to make it affordable and accessible to people with no to limited knowledge about the embedded computing world.

OVCS can help you:
* Retrofit a car or any other vehicule by providing an easy to modify system to interact with the vehicule's CAN buses
* Create a dashboard for any kind of vehicule using high-level web technologies such as the  Phoenix framework and Vue.js
* Make multiple components from different vehicule brands work together by aggregating the different CAN buses and providing a standardized set of CAN messages on the OVCS CAN bus.

## The OVCS1 frankencar

OVCS started as a project to convert an old 2007 VW Polo into a self-driving EV. It is still in active development.
